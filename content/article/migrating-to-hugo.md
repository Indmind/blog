Hello world! now my personal blog is using Hugo!

#### Why I Migrate to Hugo?
well, why I migrate to Hugo is because it easier to use and the number of awesome themes that already exist, it makes me not too focused to design this web.

#### My First Impression on Hugo
Wow! that's it. this Static Site generator is very easy! I just need to install a theme, making a post and done! no coding required. There are so many awesome themes out there, theme installation is very easy and don't forget, this Site Generator is very fast.

#### What Theme did I use?
I use [Bilberry Hugo Theme](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme) that was very amazing and beautiful. this theme is created by [Lednerb](https://github.com/Lednerb) under [MIT](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/blob/master/LICENSE.md) License
