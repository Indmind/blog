Hello there! I don't really know about blogging and what to put here, so I think I will fill this blog with some random thing. For now I will share my experince about learning [Golang](https://golang.org)

## Why do I learn Golang?
Actually, I myself don't know why I learn this beautiful language. It starts when I think that I need to learn a language that I will use it "forever". I've learned Java, C++, C#, python, ruby, PHP, javascript, and even swift that I myself don't have any iDevice. with that so many programming languages, I still have no confidence what language should I stick. I created a simple android game using libgdx that just a rolling ball that jumps over a wall that I created in my android phone using an app called AIDE, and unfortunately I reset my phone because my phone was very laggy and stupidly I don't backup it. created nothing with C++, create a game that just a ball that rolling through obstacles using C# and unity, learning some algorithm with python, created nothing with ruby, build some useless web with PHP, create useless thing again using javascript, and yeah, this is basically what I am doing all this time, and I think Golang is pretty good language to learn this year (2018)

## The End
Really just it? yeah, a very long blog right? after several days have passed... *(I will not write my experience because I can't write a blog)* I think I will not continue to learn this language and continue my journey to find a "perfect" language for me. Ok bye...
