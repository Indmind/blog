Hello someone who read this! I don't know how and where to start, so basically, I want to share you my experience on Google Code-in 2017

## What is Google Code-in?

Google Code-in 2017 is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13â€“17) to open source software development. ok that's it

## Where did I heard about Google Code-in?

I heard about Google Code-2017 from a facebook page and I thought it would be great if I joined the contest to learn how to work with others in open source projects, because I was very bad at socializing and working together, this will be a very good opportunity for me, so this year I targeted nothing and I will take just easy tasks for introductions besides my bad skills and my very bad English, maybe next year I will be more serious, and enrolled myself in the contest.

## The Beginning

When the contest started, I was confused about what to do, and I found some tasks from an organization called **Sugar Labs** that was very easy, like installing git and node, after completing the tasks, I just realized that I can only take 2 beginners task, and then, I tried to find non-beginner tasks, and still, I just claim a very easy task like learning git and trivial tasks. basically from the beginning of the contest begins until the contest ends I just do a trivial task hehe :)

After going around looking for a task, I found a fairly easy task from an organization called **coala**, the task requires us to sort the organization based on the number of completed tasks. Without thinking twice I claim the task and completed it, even though the task is very simple, it takes a lot of reviews, it's much more difficult to work together than working alone, the code check is very tight, very small mistake is a disaster. even so, I still very often make mistakes :3

I see that their task is quite easy for their **gci-leader** project that you can see it here <https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders>. **gci-leader** is a website showing all current leaders of Google Code-in 2017 <https://gci-leaders.netlify.com/>, and I began to focus on doing the task for this project and just taking the easy task. The mentors were very helpful when I was having trouble, even though I was not very active because I was very difficult to socialize and communicate. Due to my poor English, I often misunderstand what I should do in that task :0

## The End

At the end, I got a lot of experience from the contest, from how to work together on a project, write neat code, a cool technology they use that I did not know at all, and much more

Ok, that's it, sorry for my very short and bad blog. I almost never write a blog before and I apologize if there's an mistakes, because I use google translate in some parts and my English is very bad :(
