I don\u0026rsquo;t really know about blogging and what to put here, so I think I will fill this blog with some random thing. For now I will share my experince about learning Golang\nWhy do I learn Golang? Actually, I myself don\u0026rsquo;t know why I learn this beautiful language. It starts when I think that I need to learn a language that I will use it \u0026ldquo;forever\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned Java, C++, C#, python, ruby, PHP, javascript, and even swift that I myself don\u0026rsquo;t have any iDevice. with that so many programming languages, I still have no confidence what language should I stick. I created a simple android game using libgdx that just a rolling ball that jumps over a wall that I created in my android phone using an app called AIDE, and unfortunately I reset my phone because my phone was very laggy and stupidly I don\u0026rsquo;t backup it. created nothing with C++, create a game that just a ball that rolling through obstacles using C# and unity, learning some algorithm with python, created nothing with ruby, build some useless web with PHP, create useless thing again using javascript, and yeah, this is basically what I am doing all this time, and I think Golang is pretty good language to learn this year (2018)\nThe End Really just it? yeah, a very long blog right? after several days have passed\u0026hellip; (I will not write my experience because I can\u0026rsquo;t write a blog) I think I will not continue to learn this language and continue my journey to find a \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; language for me.

I don\u0026rsquo;t know how and where to start, so basically, I want to share you my experience on Google Code-in 2017\nWhat is Google Code-in? Google Code-in 2017 is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13–17) to open source software development. ok that\u0026rsquo;s it\nWhere did I heard about Google Code-in? I heard about Google Code-2017 from a facebook page and I thought it would be great if I joined the contest to learn how to work with others in open source projects, because I was very bad at socializing and working together, this will be a very good opportunity for me, so this year I targeted nothing and I will take just easy tasks for introductions besides my bad skills and my very bad English, maybe next year I will be more serious, and enrolled myself in the contest.\nThe Beginning When the contest started, I was confused about what to do, and I found some tasks from an organization called Sugar Labs that was very easy, like installing git and node, after completing the tasks, I just realized that I can only take 2 beginners task, and then, I tried to find non-beginner tasks, and still, I just claim a very easy task like learning git and trivial tasks. basically from the beginning of the contest begins until the contest ends I just do a trivial task hehe :)\nAfter going around looking for a task, I found a fairly easy task from an organization called coala, the task requires us to sort the organization based on the number of completed tasks. Without thinking twice I claim the task and completed it, even though the task is very simple, it takes a lot of reviews, it\u0026rsquo;s much more difficult to work together than working alone, the code check is very tight, very small mistake is a disaster. even so, I still very often make mistakes :3\nI see that their task is quite easy for their gci-leader project that you can see it here https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders. gci-leader is a website showing all current leaders of Google Code-in 2017 https://gci-leaders.netlify.com/, and I began to focus on doing the task for this project and just taking the easy task. The mentors were very helpful when I was having trouble, even though I was not very active because I was very difficult to socialize and communicate. Due to my poor English, I often misunderstand what I should do in that task :0\nThe End At the end, I got a lot of experience from the contest, from how to work together on a project, write neat code, a cool technology they use that I did not know at all, and much more\nOk, that\u0026rsquo;s it, sorry for my very short and bad blog. I almost never write a blog before and I apologize if there\u0026rsquo;s an mistakes, because I use google translate in some parts and my English is very bad :(\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"d472a27f69ea51240d24a5702909257a","tags":["google","codein","tech"],"title":"Experiencing Google Code-in 2017","type":"article","url":"/article/experiencing-google-code-in-2017/"}]
