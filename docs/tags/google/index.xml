      <description>Hello someone who read this! I don&amp;rsquo;t know how and where to start, so basically, I want to share you my experience on Google Code-in 2017
What is Google Code-in? Google Code-in 2017 is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13â€“17) to open source software development. ok that&amp;rsquo;s it
Where did I heard about Google Code-in? I heard about Google Code-2017 from a facebook page and I thought it would be great if I joined the contest to learn how to work with others in open source projects, because I was very bad at socializing and working together, this will be a very good opportunity for me, so this year I targeted nothing and I will take just easy tasks for introductions besides my bad skills and my very bad English, maybe next year I will be more serious, and enrolled myself in the contest.</description>
